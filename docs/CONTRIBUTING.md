# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our projects! We welcome contributions from everyone. Before you get started, please take a moment to read through this guide.

## Getting Started

Before making any changes, we encourage you to first discuss your proposed changes with the maintainers of the repository. This helps to ensure that your work aligns with the project's goals and that no one else is working on the same thing. You can reach out to us by:

* **Opening an issue:** This is the preferred method for discussing new features, bug fixes, or other changes. Please check the existing issues first to avoid duplicates.
* **Email:** You can also contact us directly via email at [devs@ghostroad.studio](mailto:devs@ghostroad.studio).

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristics. Please review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
